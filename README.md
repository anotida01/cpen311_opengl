# CPEN311 - OpenGL Debugging

A useful debugging tool for versions of the UBC CPEN 311 course that offer the Pixel Transformation Lab.

It's a small C program that allows for visualization of graphics algorithms using OpenGL.  
It also generates framebuffer test data in the .memh format used by ModelSim allowing the results to be incorparated into a testbench.
